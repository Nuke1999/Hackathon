TxDMV should not be named as a party to lawsuits to establish ownership between private parties because it is not a proper or necessary party to such a suit.",

A court order directing TxDMV to issue a title or cancel a title is not within those options and cannot be used to circumvent statutory requirements or remedies. The exclusive remedies provided by the legislature are described below:"

Bonded titles provide applicants a means of obtaining a title when they are lacking documentation or evidence that is otherwise required by the Transportation Code and TxDMV rule, because the required bond provides a safety net for anyone damaged by the issuance of a title by allowing them to recover damages through an action against the bond.",
