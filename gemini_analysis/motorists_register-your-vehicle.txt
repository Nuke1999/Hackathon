    **5.9 Disclaimer regarding inspection records available online**
    * Content: Most inspection records are available in near real time, but there may be instances when the record is not immediately available. If your vehicle passed a safety inspection (commercial vehicle, all counties) or emissions inspection* but the system is unable to electronically verify it, you may present the Vehicle Inspection Report (VIR) you received from the inspection station to the county at the time of renewal.

*If you need proof of a safety inspection (commercial vehicle) or emissions inspection to complete your vehicle’s registration renewal, visit www.mytxcar.org to download, display electronically, or print a copy of the document. Your inspection will be verified manually, and you will be permitted to renew your vehicle registration.

*Non-Commercial vehicles registered in one of the following 17 counties are not required to obtain a passing safety inspection prior to renewing vehicle registration but must still obtain a passing emissions inspection prior to renewing vehicle registration: Brazoria, Collin, Dallas, Denton, El Paso, Ellis, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Johnson, Kaufman, Montgomery, Parker, Rockwall, Tarrant, Travis, Williamson.

*If you are renewing your registration at a county subcontractor location, such as your local grocery store, they may not accept your VIR as proof of a passing safety inspection (commercial vehicle) or emissions inspection. Each county determines whether their subcontractors can verify inspection manually with a VIR. If a subcontractor is not permitted to verify by VIR, you will be directed to the county tax office to complete your renewal.
Acceptable forms of payment vary by county. Contact your county tax office for details.

            *   Heading: FAQ
            *   Content:
                * I’m a Texan currently living out of state. How do I register my vehicle in Texas?
                Content: You must register your vehicle in the state or jurisdiction where you currently live, unless you are a full-time student or active military. If you are a student or active military, contact your local county tax office in the Texas county where you last resided for more information.
                *I have not received my registration renewal notice. What should I do?*

  Content: You can renew your vehicle without the renewal notice if you provide the following to your county tax office:
                                Registration receipt from the previous year, or
                                Texas license plate number, or
                                Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
                                Government issued photo ID

                *I moved to a different address in Texas. How can I ensure that I will receive my registration renewal notice?*

  Content: It is important to update your address on your motor vehicle record. Updating your address will help ensure you receive your registration renewal notice. Failure to renew your registration is against the law and may result in a fine.
                                Update your Address in our system: <https://renew.txdmv.gov/Renew/AddressChangeServlet>
                *I sold my vehicle, why did I receive a registration renewal notice in the mail?*

  Content: Renewal notices are printed in advance, and at the time of printing our record still indicated you as the recorded owner. If you think the buyer of your vehicle did not transfer the vehicle title you should file a vehicle transfer notification. This lets us know that you no longer own the vehicle. You should file the transfer notice within 30 days of selling or trading in your vehicle in order to receive the state protection that no longer makes you responsible for that vehicle.
Note: Filing the transfer notification does not transfer vehicle ownership; it simply removes liability for what the new owner may do with your old vehicle. Contact our customer service at (888) 368-4689 or (512) 465-3000 with the VIN of the vehicle you sold for more information.
                                Submit a vehicle transfer notification: <https://webdealer.txdmv.gov/title/publicVehicleTransfer>

     *Can I legally drive my vehicle after the registration expires?*

  Content: Yes, for a limited time. A vehicle may be operated up to five working days after the registration expires without penalty. After those five days, you can receive a citation of up to $200.

                *I lost my registration sticker. How do I obtain a replacement?*

  Content: You may obtain a replacement sticker from your local county tax assessor-collector’s office for a $6 replacement fee plus the $0.50 automation fee (to upgrade the registration and title computer system). You may be required to complete and submit an Application for Replacement Vehicle Registration Sticker (Form VTR-60) to your local county tax office.
