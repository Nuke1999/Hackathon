3.2.6. Mediation Tab:

*   Mediation for Franchise Dealers and Manufacturers
*   Texas Occupations Code §2301.703 requires parties to contested cases filed under Chapter 2301 or Chapter 503 of the Transportation Code to participate in mediation before they may have a hearing at the State Office of Administrative Hearings (SOAH). The MVD Mediation Program provides mediators to help settle contested cases at no charge. MVD mediators are:
    *   Licensed attorneys who have mediation training and experience
    *   Impartial
    *   Knowledgeable of relevant laws, department precedent, and division procedures.

*   Benefits of Mediation

    *   The goal of mediation is to reach a settlement among the parties and thus avoid the need for a contested case hearing. MVD mediators have no authority to make judicial or arbitration-type decisions. MVD mediators help by facilitating focused dialogue, offering guidance, suggesting possible options, and assisting the parties to communicate their interests. Any information provided by a party to a mediator is confidential and will not be shared without the express permission of the party.
*   Mediation Process

    *   Getting Started
        *   A contested case begins when a protest or complaint is filed with MVD. The mediator(s) send a letter to the parties with acknowledgement of the case and information about the mediation process.
    *   Mediator Preference

        *   In response to the letter, each party must return the Mediation Preference Request Form choosing to use the MVD mediator(s); to request another MVD mediator; or to hire an outside mediator. When MVD receives the signed form selecting MVD Mediation, a mediator contacts each party by phone to discuss the case, the issues, and the mediation process.
    *   How It Works

        *   MVD mediator(s) continue to discuss the issues and desired outcomes with the parties involved and work to find a solution. Communications may be by phone, by email, or in-person. Cases often settle without the need for an in-person mediation meeting.
        *   Mediation is scheduled to conclude within 60 days from the date the MVD Acknowledgement Letter is sent. However, extensions may be granted.
            *   If an in-person meeting is necessary, it will be held at TxDMV headquarters in Austin, Texas. Each party is required to bring at least one person who has full settlement authority. The mediation meetings may be individual or joint sessions among the parties. The mediator(s) will discuss what each party hopes to gain from the process. It is not the mediator's role to discourage protests or pressure parties into settling.
    *   Conclusion of the Mediation Process

        *   If a settlement is reached, the mediators will offer to draft a written agreement for all parties to sign before the meeting is over. If full settlement is not reached, the remaining issues will be referred to SOAH. Within 10 days of the conclusion of mediation, the mediator(s) will provide a written report to the MVD Director and to the parties stating:
            *   whether the parties participated in mediation;
            *   whether the matter settled in whole or in part;
            *   any unresolved issues; and
            *   any other information the parties agree to report.
*   Need More Information?

    *   If you have questions about this process or are unsure whether it applies to your matter, call MVD at (512) 465-4029, and ask for the Motor Vehicle Division docket clerk.

        | Keep in mind that ALL advertisements, regardless of format, must be compliant with TxDMV advertising rules.                                                     | Advertise "free" items in your coupon if the vehicle can be purchased or leased for a lesser price without the merchandise or enticement, or if the price of the vehicle has been increased to cover the cost or any part of the cost of the merchandise or enticement. |
        | As a starting point, always ask "Is the advertisement false, deceptive, or misleading?"                                                                            | Advertise a savings claim or discount offer on used motor vehicles with your coupon.                                                                                                                                                       |
        | Inform customers on the face of the coupon that any amount listed is only available to be used toward a lease if that is the case.                                | Make guarantees or claims in your coupon that you cannot support with facts and evidence.                                                                                                                                               |
        | Disclose the conditions and requirements necessary for a consumer to receive any advertised cash amount.                                                         | Use your coupon to advertise a guaranteed amount for a consumer trade-in.                                                                                                                                                                |
        | Fully disclose that your coupon only pertains to one specific vehicle by listing a stock number if you only intend to honor the coupon for that one vehicle.        | Advertise in a misleading or deceptive manner. Consumer protection statutes in every state protect against these types of actions and if you are caught attempting to deceive consumers, the punishment can be more than monetary - your business reputation will also suffer.                                                               |
        | Let the consumer know if your coupon only applies toward the purchase of a demonstrator or factory executive/official vehicle.                                      | Think you can "write yourself" out of having to comply with the rules by hiding all the important information into a disclaimer at the bottom of the coupon using a small type or font.                                                    |
        | Remember that any featured savings claim or discount offer for a new motor vehicle, when advertised, must be the savings claim or discount which is available to any and all members of the buying public. | Mislead consumers as to which vehicle or vehicles your coupon applies to by using confusing layouts, headlines, illustrations, or type or font size in your coupon, especially if it is part of a boarded advertisement.                        |
