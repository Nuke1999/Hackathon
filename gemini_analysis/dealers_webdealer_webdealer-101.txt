"webDEALER is the system used to create Buyer Tags (or other tags) and process title applications. Users who have accounts for **both** eTAG and webDEALER can now issue tags and create title applications within the webDEALER system. As a result of House Bill (HB) 3927, 87th Legislature, Regular Session (2021), there is now a limit to the number of temporary tags a dealer or converter can issue. More information regarding the yearly temporary tag limits can be viewed below."

"The webDEALER | eTAG system is designed to make processing dealer tags fast and easy for dealerships throughout the state while making temporary tag information available in almost real-time to law enforcement."

*   "Works via a web-based application"
*   "Provides greater security by using unique numbers on every eTAG"
*   "Replaces old style tags that are no longer legal"

"Make sure you have printed your allotment of Internet Down tags in case they are needed when webDEALER is unavailable."

#### 4.3.2. How to Use the Tags Tab

"Where They Go"

"eTAG is to be placed on all (new, used, and trailers) vehicles sold."

*   "eTAG needs to be placed in the rear license plate display area of the vehicle."
*   "Paper tags should be secured with double sided tape or with a license plate holder to keep the tag from flapping up in the wind."
*   "If the buyer wants to put their old plates on the “new” vehicle they buy, the eTAG must go on top of the old plate until the registration sticker is issued by the county tax office. As a service to the customer, the temporary tag may be placed over the metal plate so the buyer can simply remove the paper tag once they receive their registration sticker from you."

"Transporting Vehicles To and From Auctions"

"When sending a vehicle to the auction, you may issue a vehicle-specific dealer tag for the specific vehicle that will be driven to the auction to be sold. If the vehicle is not sold, it can be brought back to the lot on that same tag. If the vehicle is sold, then the buying dealer will put a dealer agent tag on the vehicle."

"If you are buying vehicles from an auction, you should take agent specific dealer tags with you to the auction to put on the vehicles you buy to be transported back to your lot. If you buy through an online auction, you can fax your agent specific dealer tags to the transport company for mounting on the vehicle if it is driven back to the dealer lot."

#### 4.3.3. Reprinting and Voiding Tags Tab

"The webDEALER | eTAG System allows you to:"

*   "Void tags"
*   "Correct errors and reissue the tag"
*   "Replace lost or stolen tags by reprinting the same tag"

"Here are a few tips:"

*   "You do not have to print a dealer's tag every time a vehicle is demonstrated: With the Agent Specific eTAG you can issue an agent’s tag to a particular agent to be used by that person on whatever vehicle they drive for the dealer. The dealer is still responsible for that agent’s tag and can void it at any time."
*   "To reprint a specific numbered tag image: look under the Tags tab and select “Reprint Tag Images.” Enter the tag number, VIN, or Name of Purchaser and select “Search.” Follow the screen instructions to reprint the eTAG."
*   "To create an Agent Specific Dealer Tag: first add agent names to the list. Click on the Home Page select “Manage Agent” from the Account Maintenance section. Click “Create Agent” then type in the First and Last Name of the agent; then click “save”. The name will now appear on the list of agents when you create agent specific tags."

"Please note: only one tag at one time can be issued for a VIN, whether it is a dealer tag or buyer tag."

#### 4.3.4. Temporary Tag Limits Tab

"The TxDMV has been authorized to establish a maximum number of temporary tags a dealer or converter may issue in a calendar year. As part of this process, the dealer or converter will be able to monitor their temporary tag limits in real time through the eTAG system. The maximum temporary tag limit and how many temporary tags are remaining will be updated every time a tag is assigned."

"When a new dealer or converter is licensed, they are automatically given a standard number of temporary tags. Generally, the amount of temporary tags given to a dealer or converter will be sufficient for the remainder of the calendar year. However, a dealer or converter may request additional tags once they have used 50% of the annual allotment for each specific tag type (agent tag, buyer tag, vehicle specific tag, and/or converter tag). The requests must be submitted in eLICENSING by selecting “apply” under the eTAG Limits icon."

"For more information regarding how the dealer’s yearly limits are calculated please review TAC §215.152."
