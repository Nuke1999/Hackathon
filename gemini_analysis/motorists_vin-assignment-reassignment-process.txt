   *   **Heading:** Steps to Obtaining an Assigned or Reassigned Number and Titling a Vehicle, Including a Trailer and Semitrailer
   *   **Step 1:**
        *   **Text:** "Owner obtains a completed Law Enforcement Identification Number Inspection (Form VTR-68-A) from an authorized inspector. Authorized inspectors can be found by contacting an MVCPA grantee organization or by contacting a TxDMV Regional Service Center."
        *   **Link 1:**
            *   **Link Text:** MVCPA grantee organization
            *   **URL:** /mvcpa-grantees
            *   **Target:** _blank
        *   **Link 2:**
            *   **Link Text:** TxDMV Regional Service Center
            *   **URL:** /regional-service-centers
            *   **Target:** _blank
        *   **Bullet Point 1:** "For manufactured vehicles, the completed Form VTR-68-A must include the vehicle's year and make identified by the authorized inspector. If a year and make cannot be determined, TxDMV cannot issue an assigned or reassigned number or title the vehicle."
        *   **Bullet Point 2:** "For assembled or homemade vehicles, the authorized inspector must identify that the vehicle was assembled from parts on the completed Form VTR-68-A."
   *   **Step 2:**
        *   **Text:** "Owner confirms they have sufficient ownership evidence. Depending on the type of vehicle, ownership evidence may include:"
        *   **Bullet Point 1:** "title in the name of or properly assigned to the applicant, which may be used when the original VIN is identified by an authorized inspector."
        *   **Bullet Point 2:** "bill of sale or receipt, which may be used in limited situations."
        *   **Bullet Point 3:** "bonded title application, which may be used for assembled or homemade vehicles."
        *   **Note:** *Acceptable proof of ownership can vary depending on the vehicle. Contact a TxDMV Regional Service Center for assistance identifying acceptable documentation.*

   *   **Step 3:**
        *   **Text:** "If the owner does not have and cannot get sufficient ownership evidence, the owner can get a court order awarding ownership to serve as acceptable evidence."
        *   **Bullet Point 1:** "TxDMV should not be named as a party to a suit to establish ownership. TxDMV does not have any ownership interest in the vehicle and is not a proper or necessary party."
        *   **Bullet Point 2:** "The court order must clearly declare that the applicant is the owner of the vehicle and list the year and make of the vehicle identified in the Form VTR-68-A, so TxDMV can tell both documents apply to the same vehicle. If the Form VTR-68-A identifies a different year, make, or VIN than what is listed in the court order, the court order will not be accepted as ownership evidence."
   *   **Step 4:**
        *   **Text:** "Owner applies for an assigned or reassigned vehicle identification number at a TxDMV Regional Service Center by providing the following documentation:"
