*   **3.1 Introductory Text:**
    "A person or entity needing to dispose of a motor vehicle to a motor vehicle demolisher may apply to the department for a Certificate of Authority. A Certificate of Authority facilitates the transfer of a motor vehicle to a motor vehicle demolisher for the purposes of crushing and destroying the motor vehicle.

    A person (including an entity or unit of government) may apply to the department for authority to dispose of a motor vehicle if:
    *   The person is the recorded owner
    *   The person has been transferred ownership of the motor vehicle
    *   The vehicle is an abandoned motor vehicle and is in the possession of the person or located on property owned by the person

    If the applicant applying for authority to dispose of the motor vehicle is not the owner on record or does not have evidence that ownership has been transferred to them, the department is required to make a notification to any owners and lienholders the department is able to identify by First Class Mail. If the department is unable to locate a motor vehicle record, the notification is posted on this webpage. In either scenario, the owner(s) and lienholder(s) have 20 days to claim the motor vehicle. If the vehicle remains unclaimed, the certificate of authority is issued on the 21st day after the notification is mailed or posted on this page."
