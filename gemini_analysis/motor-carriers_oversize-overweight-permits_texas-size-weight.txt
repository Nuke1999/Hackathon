**10. Considerations:**

*   This document focuses on the *content* of the page.  Styling, layout, and interactive elements (beyond the accordion functionality) are outside the scope of this specification.
*   The term "CTA Box" refers to a visual call-to-action element (button or similar).
*   Superscript numbers in the legal size and weight table indicate footnotes, which should be displayed below the table.
* All https://, http:// and / links should be considered internal, unless specified.
