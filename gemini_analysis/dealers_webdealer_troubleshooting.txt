## 2.  Goal

## 3. Detailed Content Requirements

**Page Title:** webDEALER | eTAG Troubleshooting

### 3.1. Tabbed Content

The main content is organized into four tabs:

#### 3.1.1. Tab 1: Computer Settings

**Tab Title:** Computer Settings

**Content:**

*   "Pop-up blockers will need to be disabled for the webDEALER system. In most cases, you can set your pop-up blocker to "always allow" for the webDEALER system. If you are not automatically prompted to allow for pop-ups when you enter the webDEALER system, you will need to enter **https://webdealer.txdmv.gov/** into your pop-up program as an allowed site."
*   "Plug-ins should be enabled for the webDEALER site."
*   "ActiveX filtering should be unchecked within the webDEALER site. If you have problems printing with the Adobe Reader® ActiveX® plug-in while using the Internet Explorer® browser, here is another workaround:"
    1.  "In Adobe Reader® or Acrobat®, choose Edit > Preferences."
    2.  "Select Internet."
    3.  "Deselect "Display PDF In Browser", and then click OK."
*   "Phishing filters may interfere with processing webDEALER. Disable the filters on your computer or set them to "always allow" access from **https://webdealer.txdmv.gov/**."
*   "Set your computer's security setting at medium or make an exception for the webDEALER system by adding **https://webdealer.txdmv.gov/** to your allowed sites."
*   "Your computer's content advisor may need to be disabled or set to allow access to https://webdealer.txdmv.gov/."

"If you are unsure of how to change the settings on your computer, please consult the "Help" manual that was installed on your computer with the operating system. If you have installed other programs, such as an anti-virus program or your online provider gave you phishing filters and pop-up blocker features, please consult with your internet service provider about how to change your settings for use with the webDEALER system."

"Other considerations"

*   "Check for any critical updates to your operating system, browser(s) and Adobe Acrobat® or Adobe Reader®. Visit the respective software manufacturer's website to check for updates and follow their instructions for downloading and installing these updates."
*   "If problems persist, you may uninstall and reinstall Adobe Reader®. Sometimes, an incomplete installation of this application may prevent printing."
*   "If printing problems persist while using Internet Explorer®, you may wish to install another browser to use with webDEALER, such as Mozilla Firefox®."

#### 3.1.2. Tab 2: Printing Problems

**Tab Title:** Printing Problems

**Content:**

"If you click on "Print Tag" or "Reprint Tag" and get an error message, first be sure you have Adobe Reader installed on your computer."

"If you are still having trouble printing with Internet Explorer and Adobe Reader, try using an alternate web browser or change your Adobe Reader preferences to open documents directly in Adobe Reader. Here's how:"

1.  "Open Adobe Acrobat Reader."
2.  "Select "Preferences" from the Edit menu."
3.  "Select "Internet" from the Categories: list."
4.  "Uncheck the box that says "Display PDF in browser""

"When you click on "Print Tag" Internet Explorer will ask you to verify that you want to download the file. Then retry the webpage. The tag and receipts will now open in a separate, stand-alone version of the Adobe Reader."

"If you can log in but cannot print or if you can't log in to the webDEALER system"

*   "If you can log onto the system but can't print the eTAG images, try reprinting the tag image. If this does not work, use an Internet Down Tag to manually enter the owner and vehicle information, and contact the webDEALER | eTAG Help Desk for assistance."
*   "If you have already received your login information from MVD and you can't login to the webDEALER database then contact the webDEALER | eTAG Help Desk by emailing eTag@TxDMV.gov or call (512) 465-4010 for assistance, Monday – Friday 7:00 a.m. - 5:30 p.m."

#### 3.1.3. Tab 3: Trailers without VINs

**Tab Title:** Trailers without VINs

**Content:**

"Many utility trailers less than 4,000 lbs. do not have a VIN. The eTAG System requires a VIN to obtain a buyer's tag or a vehicle-specific dealer tag. To complete the transaction, in the VIN field, you will enter the words "novin" along with the date and time."

"For example: novin04052015341 represents a no VIN trailer eTAG transaction was processed on 04/05/2015 at 3:41 pm."

"You will still have the option to obtain a VIN for the trailer frame from the TxDMV Regional Service Centers."
