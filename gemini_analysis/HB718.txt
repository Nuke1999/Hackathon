*   **New License Plates: Beginning July 1, 2025, Texas motor vehicle dealers will no longer issue the following from the eTAG system:**
        *   Buyer Tags
        *   Internet Down Tags
        *   Vehicle Specific Tags
        *   Agent Specific Tags
*   **Paragraph 5:** Instead of these temporary tags, dealers will issue metal plates at the time of the sale. In most cases, general issue license plates will be issued and registered in the name of the buyer.
*   **Paragraph 6:** Implementation of HB 718 created four limited-use metal plates to be used by dealers or county offices for specific temporary vehicle registration needs:
*   **Table:** (See details below)
*   **Paragraph 7:** These new license plates will not replace current metal dealer license plates or the general issue plates that dealers will most frequently issue. The current dealer metal plates remain permissible for personal use.
*   **Paragraph 8:** Additionally, HB 718 will modify the process of issuing general issue license plates. Dealers will receive an allocation of general issue license plates directly to their licensed location that will be issued to a vehicle at the time of sale.
*   **Paragraph 9:** **Plates Remain with Vehicle:** When a consumer sells or trades-in a vehicle to a dealer, the general issue license plates registered to the vehicle will stay with that vehicle. Dealers must store the plates securely and assign them to the next person who purchases the vehicle. Specialty and personalized plates will still be retained by the customer.
*   **Paragraph 10:** **License Plate Distribution:** For most plates, HB 718 transitions from the current distribution model of license plates delivered to dealers by county offices to a direct-to-dealer model for general issue plates. Plates will be produced by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) and shipped to a centralized distribution warehouse operated by a TxDMV contractor. A sufficient supply of plates will be maintained in the warehouse for distribution year-round to meet sales demand.
*   **Paragraph 11:** Dealers will order, track, and assign plates easily and directly through a new web-based, accessible Inventory Management System (IMS).
*   **Paragraph 12:** ***IMPORTANT:*** Dealers must complete webDEALER training or be active users of webDEALER before they can receive plate shipments.
*   **Paragraph 13:** Dealers will order Dealer Temporary Plates through the eLICENSING system, just like the current process for existing Dealer Plates distributed by TxDMV. eLICENSING User Guide for Dealer Plate Applications: Standard Dealer Plate & Dealer Temporary Plate

*   **Paragraph 14:** **Plate Storage and Security:** Rules adopted by the TxDMV Board in October 2024 require dealers to secure plates in a locked room, closet, or one or more securely locked, substantially constructed safes or steel cabinets bolted to the floor or wall. Dealers must control employee access to the storage location to ensure plates are used only for legitimate sales.
*   **Paragraph 15:** **Vehicle Transfer Notification:** On the sale or transfer of a motor vehicle to a dealer, the dealer must submit a Vehicle Transfer Notification (VTN). Dealers can submit the VTN online through the department's license plate system, currently known as eTAG.
*   **Paragraph 16:** **Dealer Compliance:** The new Dealer Compliances Services Section in the TxDMV Enforcement Division will inspect dealer locations to verify compliance with license plate and premises requirements. Staff will offer education and guidance to dealers found non-compliant as they adapt to the new requirements.

*   **Paragraph 3:** **One-Trip and 30-Day Permits:** The law eliminates the 30-day and one-trip paper permits issued by county tax offices and TxDMV Regional Service Centers (RSCs). Beginning July 1, 2025, in place of paper permits, counties and RSCs will issue metal Temporary Registration License Plates with an expiration sticker on the plates.

*   **Paragraph 2:** **Buying a Vehicle from a Dealer:** Customers who purchase a vehicle from a Texas dealer will receive metal license plates at the time the dealer delivers the vehicle, allowing them to immediately display the plates and operate the vehicle while awaiting their registration window sticker.
*   **Paragraph 3:** **Trading In a Vehicle to a Dealer:** Effective July 1, 2025, when customers trade-in a vehicle, the dealer will keep the license plates registered to the vehicle (unless they are specialty or personalized plates), store them securely, then assign them to the new buyer when the dealer sells the vehicle at a later date. For Texas-titled vehicles, dealers will be required to submit a Vehicle Transfer Notification (VTN) to TxDMV notifying the department of the date the original customer sold the vehicle so their vehicle record can be updated.
    *   Link "Vehicle Transfer Notification (VTN)": [https://webdealer.txdmv.gov/title/publicVehicleTransfer](https://webdealer.txdmv.gov/title/publicVehicleTransfer)
*   **Paragraph 4:** **Buying or Selling a Vehicle in a Private Sale:** In private sales, the buyer will keep the license plates and register the vehicle in their name with their county tax assessor-collector's office. Sellers of Texas-titled vehicles should submit a Vehicle Transfer Notification (VTN) within 30 days of the sale to update their motor vehicle record. To process the VTN the seller is required to submit the buyer’s name and contact information – which should be collected by the seller at the time of sale.
