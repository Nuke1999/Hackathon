          "Internet Explorer (IE) is an outdated browser that does not fully support the latest web standards and has a number of security concerns. Microsoft replaced IE11 - the last version released - with Edge as the default browser in 2015. While most of our websites will function correctly with IE11, we recommend using a modern browser (see list of supported browsers above) to ensure a secure and fully functional experience."
