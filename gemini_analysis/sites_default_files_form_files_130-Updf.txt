Okay, here's a product requirements document focusing on content extraction and recreation from the provided HTML.  Since the HTML represents a PDF viewer embedded in a webpage, the core requirement is to represent the *content* of that PDF, understanding we don't have the PDF *file* itself, only the fact that it's intended to be displayed.

**Product Requirements Document: PDF Viewer Content Placeholder**

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for recreating the content structure of a web page that displays a PDF document using an embedded viewer. The goal is to produce a placeholder representing the PDF content, given that the actual PDF file is unavailable.

**2. Goal**

To render an HTML structure that accurately represents the presence of a PDF document within the webpage, capturing essential attributes and behaviors associated with PDF display.

**3. Scope**

This document covers:

*   Representing the PDF content as an embedded element.

It does NOT cover:

*   Detailed design elements (colors, fonts, specific layout).
*   Implementation of language selection, search, navigation menus, or footers (as instructed).
*   Functionality of a PDF viewer (scrolling, zooming, etc.)

**4. Content Requirements**

The HTML structure must accurately reflect the provided HTML, specifically the embedded PDF element.

*   **Element Type:**  An `<embed>` element is used.
*   **Attributes (and Values):**
    *   `height`: "100%"  (This indicates the PDF should fill the entire height of its container).
    *   `internalid`:  "AF6EBE1E69E4372BF951322C83E15927" (This is an internal identifier, retain it).
    *   `name`: "AF6EBE1E69E4372BF951322C83E15927" (This is a name attribute, retain it).
    *   `src`: "about:blank" (This indicates the PDF source is initially blank).
    *   `style`:  "position:absolute; left: 0; top: 0;" (This is critical for positioning the embedded element, meaning the pdf will be placed at the top left of the page.)
    *   `type`: "application/pdf" (This specifies the content type as PDF).
    *   `width`: "100%" (This indicates the PDF should fill the entire width of its container).

*   **Positioning:** The `style="position:absolute; left: 0; top: 0;"` attribute is *critical*. It dictates that the embedded PDF viewer is positioned absolutely within its containing element (the `<body>` in this case) and anchored to the top-left corner.

*   **Containing Element:** The `<embed>` element is contained within a `<body>` element that has specific styling:
    *   `style`: "height: 100%; width: 100%; overflow: hidden; margin:0px; background-color: rgb(40, 40, 40);"

        *   `height: 100%`:  The body takes up the full height of its parent.
        *   `width: 100%`: The body takes up the full width of its parent.
        *   `overflow: hidden`:  Any content exceeding the body's dimensions is hidden.
        *   `margin: 0px`:  Removes any default margins from the body.
        *   `background-color: rgb(40, 40, 40)`: Sets the background color of the body to a dark gray.

**5. Functional Requirements**

*   **PDF Placeholder:** While the `src="about:blank"` attribute initially displays nothing, the implementation should allow for a future replacement of this attribute with a URL to an actual PDF document.

*   **Full-Screen Display:** The combination of `height="100%"`, `width="100%"`, `position:absolute`, and the body styles are designed to make the PDF (once loaded via `src`) occupy the entire browser window.  The rendered output must respect this intention.

**6. Error Handling**

*   If the PDF fails to load (hypothetically if `src` were populated), a suitable error message or fallback mechanism should be implemented.  This is outside the scope of *this* document (which focuses on the initial blank state) but should be considered in future development.

**7.  Connections to Other Sites/Resources (Crucially important)**

*   The `src="about:blank"` attribute *implies* that a *future* update to this attribute would point to a valid URL for a PDF document.  This is the critical link to external resources.  The implementation must support this dynamic linking.  This future URL is unknown at this time, but the framework must accommodate it.

**8.  Example Output HTML (for clarity):**

```html
<html>
<head></head>
<body style="height: 100%; width: 100%; overflow: hidden; margin:0px; background-color: rgb(40, 40, 40);">
    <embed height="100%" internalid="AF6EBE1E69E4372BF951322C83E15927" name="AF6EBE1E69E4372BF951322C83E15927" src="about:blank" style="position:absolute; left: 0; top: 0;" type="application/pdf" width="100%"/>
</body>
</html>
```

**9. Notes for the Implementor**

*   The `internalid` and `name` attributes may be specific to the PDF viewer being used. While their exact function is unknown without further context, they *must* be included as specified in the original HTML.
*   The CSS styles applied to the `body` element are crucial for ensuring the PDF viewer takes up the entire viewport.  Do not omit these.
*   The overall goal is to create a functional *placeholder* for a PDF viewer.  The content itself is initially blank, but the structure is essential for future integration of a PDF document.
