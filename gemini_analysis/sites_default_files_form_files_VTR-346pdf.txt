Okay, here's a product requirements document based on the provided HTML. Since the HTML describes embedding a PDF, the core content is the PDF's textual data.

**Product Requirements Document: PDF Viewer**

**1.  Introduction**

This document outlines the content and requirements for recreating the core functionality of a web page designed to display a PDF document. The page embeds a PDF file using the `<embed>` tag, aiming for a full-screen viewing experience. This document focuses on extracting the likely text content from that PDF (even though we only have the HTML wrapper) so the new implementor can assume that the original pdf is not accessible.

**2.  Goal**

The goal is to provide content that will be displayed in the absence of the PDF document.

**3.  Scope**

This document covers:

*   The textual content assumed to be within the embedded PDF.

This document *does not* cover:

*   Visual design elements (colors, fonts, layout).
*   Navigation menus, search bars, or footers.
*   PDF rendering library details.
*   Any interactions other than viewing the content.

**4.  Content Requirements**

Since we don't have the PDF's content, we must make a reasonable assumption about what it might be.  For this example, let's assume the PDF is a basic informational document with a title, some sections, and links.  The AI implementor should create placeholder content reflecting a typical informational document format.

**4.1 Document Title**

*   **Content:** "Placeholder Informational Document"

**4.2 Section 1: Introduction**

*   **Heading:** "Introduction"
*   **Paragraph 1:** "This is a placeholder introduction to demonstrate the functionality of the PDF viewer replacement. The actual PDF would contain more detailed information relevant to the original document's purpose."

**4.3 Section 2: Key Concepts**

*   **Heading:** "Key Concepts"
*   **Paragraph 1:** "This section would typically outline the key concepts or principles discussed in the full document. For example..."
*   **List:**
    *   Concept A
    *   Concept B
    *   Concept C

**4.4 Section 3: Related Resources**

*   **Heading:** "Related Resources"
*   **Paragraph 1:** "The following resources are for additional information."
*   **Link 1:**
    *   **Text:** "Example Website"
    *   **URL:** `https://www.example.com/`
*   **Link 2:**
    *   **Text:** "Another Helpful Resource"
    *   **URL:** `https://www.helpfulresource.org/`

**4.5 Section 4: Conclusion**
*   **Heading:** "Conclusion"
*   **Paragraph 1:** "This concludes the placeholder content for the PDF viewer. The purpose is to demonstrate functionality where the PDF document is unavailable."

**5. Functional Requirements**

*   **FR1: Full-Screen Display:** The content should occupy the full browser window (or as close as possible without relying on specific styling instructions).  It should scale reasonably to different screen sizes.
*   **FR2: Content Display:** The content should be displayed in a readable format (using HTML tags for headings, paragraphs, lists, and links).
*   **FR3: Link Functionality:** Links should be clickable and navigate to the specified URLs.

**6.  Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **NF1: Performance:** Content should load quickly.
*   **NF2: Accessibility:** The content should be structured semantically to be as accessible as possible (e.g., using proper heading tags, alt text for images if any, etc.).

**7. HTML Structure (Example)**

The implementor should render the extracted content using the following basic HTML structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Placeholder Document</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Placeholder Informational Document</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a placeholder introduction to demonstrate the functionality of the PDF viewer replacement. The actual PDF would contain more detailed information relevant to the original document's purpose.</p>

<h2>Key Concepts</h2>
<p>This section would typically outline the key concepts or principles discussed in the full document. For example...</p>
<ul>
  <li>Concept A</li>
  <li>Concept B</li>
  <li>Concept C</li>
</ul>

<h2>Related Resources</h2>
<p>The following resources are for additional information.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.example.com/">Example Website</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.helpfulresource.org/">Another Helpful Resource</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This concludes the placeholder content for the PDF viewer. The purpose is to demonstrate functionality where the PDF document is unavailable.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

**8.  Success Criteria**

*   The placeholder content is displayed correctly in the browser.
*   Links are functional.
*   The content occupies a significant portion of the browser window.
