    The Texas Department of Motor Vehicles (TxDMV) offers training webinars to help dealers understand the rules and regulations that govern their businesses. Each day-long webinar includes information that enables dealers to stay in compliance and avoid common unintentional violations. Topics include: advertising, selling and financing motor vehicles, trade-ins, titles, and eTAG. During webinars, dealers have the opportunity to interact with TxDMV staff to better understand how the law and rules impact business practices.

Texas Department of Motor Vehicles training webinars are provided by TxDMV at no cost to dealers or their employees. We invite everyone who is interested in working in the motor vehicle industry to attend. The Motor Vehicle Dealer Manual and other useful materials are available under the “Publications” link.
