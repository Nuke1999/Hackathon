##### 3.1.2.1. Selling a Vehicle Tab

*   **Content:**
    *   **Vehicle Transfer Notification Call to Action:**
        *   "Submit a Vehicle Transfer Notification"
        *   Link to: `https://webdealer.txdmv.gov/title/publicVehicleTransfer`
    *   **Column 1 Content:**
        *   "Vehicles are required to be titled in the buyer's name within 30 days from the date of sale. Failing to properly transfer a vehicle into the buyer's name could result in the seller being held responsible for tickets, toll violations or even crimes committed with the vehicle. To ensure this doesn't happen to you, **accompany the buyer to your county tax office to ensure a vehicle title application is filed**. A dealer is not required to title in the dealership’s name if you sell or trade-in your vehicle to a licensed motor vehicle dealer. The vehicle stays in your name until it is sold to an individual, which may take months or in some cases, years. To protect yourself, file a Vehicle Transfer Notification. When a vehicle transfer notification is received, TxDMV updates the motor vehicle record to show the vehicle as sold. When you file the notification within 30 days from the date of sale, you cannot be held responsible for parking tickets and toll violations that have been committed by the person who purchased the vehicle."
    *   **Column 2 Content:**
        *   "Find Your Local Tax Office & DMV"
        *   DMV Locator form (Select County)

    *   "**Provide the buyer with the following:**"

        *   "Signed [link to `/sites/default/files/form_files/130-U.pdf`]Application for Texas Title and/or Registration (Form 130-U) with the sales price clearly shown."
    *   "A seller should keep detailed written records of any transaction, including contact information for the buyer, the date of sale and information on the vehicle, including the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)."
    *   "The seller has the option to remove their license plates and registration sticker from the vehicle. There are three options for removed license plates:"
        *   "The seller may transfer their license plates to a vehicle to be purchased, if the vehicle classification is the same."
        *   "The seller may keep their license plates for future transfer to another vehicle, but the registration sticker is not transferred."
        *   "If the seller does not transfer or keep their license plates, the license plates must be disposed of by defacing the front of the plates, either with permanent black ink or another method in order to prevent fraudulent use."

        *   "When buying from a private individual, make sure the title and registration match the name and address of the person selling the car."
        *   "Be cautious of a seller with no fixed address, place of employment or phone number."
