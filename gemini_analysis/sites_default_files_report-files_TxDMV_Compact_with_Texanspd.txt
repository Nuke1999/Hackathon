Okay, here's a product requirements document based on the provided HTML, focusing on content extraction and relationships, geared towards AI implementation.  I'm assuming the goal is to reproduce the functionality of displaying a PDF within a webpage.

**Product Requirements Document: PDF Embedding Webpage**

**1.  Introduction**

   *   **Purpose:** This document outlines the requirements for recreating a webpage that embeds and displays a PDF document.  The current implementation utilizes an `<embed>` tag within a full-screen HTML structure.
   *   **Goal:** To create a functional webpage that displays a PDF.

**2.  Content and Functionality Requirements**

   *   **2.1. PDF Embedding:**
        *   **Description:** The primary function of the webpage is to display a PDF document.
        *   **Implementation:** The PDF should be embedded within the HTML page using an appropriate method.
        *   **Source:**The PDF source URL is dynamically provided. The current implementation uses `src="about:blank"`, which must be replaced with a URL for the page to work correctly.
        *   **Attributes:** The PDF embed element must have the following attributes:
            *   `height="100%"`:  Ensures the embedded PDF viewer takes up the full height of the browser window.
            *   `internalid="8E8A1ADB7ADDE6ECC50827F0F6D05D2B"`: a identifier tag for the embed section
            *   `name="8E8A1ADB7ADDE6ECC50827F0F6D05D2B"`: A name given to the embed
            *   `src="[PDF_URL]"`: Specifies the URL of the PDF document to be displayed. **[PDF_URL] needs to be replaced with a VALID URL.** Example: `"https://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf"`
            *   `style="position:absolute; left: 0; top: 0;"`:  Positions the embedded PDF element at the top-left corner of its containing element (in this case, the `body`).
            *   `type="application/pdf"`:  Specifies the MIME type of the content being embedded.
            *   `width="100%"`:  Ensures the embedded PDF viewer takes up the full width of the browser window.
    *   **2.2. Full-Screen Display:**
        *   **Description:** The webpage must ensure the PDF viewer occupies the entire browser window.
        *   **Implementation:**  Styles should be applied to the `body` element to remove margins and ensure full height and width.
        *   **Styles:**
            *   `height: 100%;`: Sets the height of the `body` to 100% of the viewport height.
            *   `width: 100%;`: Sets the width of the `body` to 100% of the viewport width.
            *   `overflow: hidden;`: Hides any scrollbars that might appear.
            *   `margin: 0px;`: Removes any default margins from the `body`.
            *   `background-color: rgb(40, 40, 40);`: Sets the background color to dark gray.

**3. Functional requirements**
   * The webpage must adjust dynamically if the window size changes.
   * The embedded PDF must be visible and readable without requiring the user to scroll, zoom, or perform any manual adjustments.

**4. Non-Functional Requirements**

   *   **4.1. Performance:**
        *   The PDF should load and display quickly.  Consider using a lazy-loading technique if PDF is large.
   *   **4.2. Accessibility:**
        *   While the base HTML doesn't address accessibility, future iterations should consider adding accessibility features, such as ARIA attributes, to the embedded PDF viewer.

**5. Dependencies**

   *   The webpage requires a browser with PDF rendering capabilities (most modern browsers have this built-in).
   *   The webpage requires a valid URL to a PDF document.

**6.  Error Handling**

   *   If the PDF fails to load (e.g., due to an invalid URL or network error), a user-friendly error message should be displayed in the embed element.

**7.  Future Considerations**

   *   **PDF Viewer Controls:**  Consider adding controls (zoom, pan, print, download) for the PDF viewer, either using browser defaults or a custom JavaScript-based solution.
   *   **Dynamic PDF Loading:**  Implement a mechanism to dynamically change the PDF URL, perhaps through a form input or a query parameter in the URL.
   *   **Accessibility Enhancements:**  Add ARIA attributes to improve accessibility for users with disabilities.

**Example Code (Illustrative - Needs Adaptation for Target Platform):**

```html
<html>
<head>
</head>
<body style="height: 100%; width: 100%; overflow: hidden; margin:0px; background-color: rgb(40, 40, 40);">
  <embed height="100%" internalid="8E8A1ADB7ADDE6ECC50827F0F6D05D2B" name="8E8A1ADB7ADDE6ECC50827F0F6D05D2B" src="https://www.africau.edu/images/default/sample.pdf" style="position:absolute; left: 0; top: 0;" type="application/pdf" width="100%"/>
</body>
</html>
```

**Important Considerations for the AI Implementor:**

*   **PDF_URL Placeholder:**  The `src="[PDF_URL]"` attribute in the example is a placeholder.  The AI must be able to dynamically populate this with a valid URL to a PDF document.  The method for providing this URL (e.g., command-line argument, API call, configuration file) is outside the scope of this document.
*   **Error Handling:** The AI needs to incorporate error handling logic to catch scenarios where the PDF cannot be loaded and display an appropriate message to the user.
*   **Dynamic Resizing:**  Ensure the PDF viewer resizes correctly when the browser window is resized.  This might involve using CSS media queries or JavaScript event listeners.
*   **MIME Type:** Double check the correct mime type for the file type you choose.
