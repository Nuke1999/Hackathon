"TxDMV Dealer Education FAQ"

**3.2.2. Question 1:**

"Which dealers must take the new pre-licensing training?"

*   **Answer:** "The pre-licensing training requirement applies only to dealers with an independent motor vehicle GDN. These dealers are licensed to buy, sell, or exchange used cars, trucks, motor homes, neighborhood vehicles, recreational off-road vehicles (ROV), all-terrain vehicles (ATV), and utility vehicles (UTV). All applicants for new licenses and renewal applicants licensed less than 10 years on September 1, 2019 will be required to complete the one-time training."

**3.2.3. Question 2:**

"Which dealers don’t have to take the new training?"

*   **Answer:** "The licensing training requirement does not apply to independent motorcycle dealers, independent travel trailer dealers, independent mobility motor vehicle dealers, utility trailer/semi-trailer dealers, wholesale dealers, wholesale auction dealers, salvage dealers, or franchised license dealers."

**3.2.4. Question 3:**

"When will the new requirement be implemented?"

**3.2.5. Question 4:**

"How will applicants show that they have completed the required training?"

*   **Answer:** "After the training requirement goes into effect, the eLICENSING system will prompt affected applicants to upload their certificate of course completion as part of the regular application process."

**3.2.6. Question 5:**

"Is every employee of the dealership required to take the course?"

*   **Answer:** "No, only one owner and/or operating manager for the business is required to take the course. The individual who completes the course must be one of the owners or managers for the business listed on the application."

**3.2.7. Question 6:**

"What if the individual who completes the course is no longer with the business?"

*   **Answer:** "A new owner and/or operating manager for the business must complete the course prior to the next license renewal."

**3.2.8. Question 7:**

"I changed legal entities four years ago, so my license active date doesn’t reflect my 15 years of experience. Do I have to take the course?"

*   **Answer:** "No, you will not need to take the course. When eLICENSING prompts you to upload a certificate of course completion, you should upload a statement listing the dates, license holder names, and license numbers you have been associated with over the years. Once your license specialist verifies you were licensed for more than 10 years on September 1, 2019, you will not be required to take the course."

**3.2.9. Question 8:**

"I have more than 10 years of experience as an Independent Motor Vehicle license holder, but closed one license, then obtained a new license. When I renew my license will I have to take the course?"

*   **Answer:** "No, you will not need to take the course. When eLICENSING prompts you to upload a certificate of course completion, you should upload a statement listing the dates, license holder names, and license numbers you have been associated with over the years. Once your license specialist verifies you were licensed for more than 10 years on September 1, 2019, you will not be required to take the course."

**3.2.10. Question 9:**

"If I have multiple independent motor vehicle GDNs, can I take the course once and upload the same certificate of completion?"

*   **Answer:** "If you, as an owner and/or operating manager for the business, have already completed the course, you do not need to take it again. You may upload the same course completion certificate for each renewal application."

**3.2.11. Question 10:**

"Are courses available in Spanish?"
