**3. Functional Requirements**

*   **Links:** All hyperlinks (<a> tags) must be functional and point to the URLs specified in the source HTML. The `target="_blank"` attribute should be respected.
*   **JavaScript Functions:** The `goTo()` and `changeLanguage()` JavaScript functions should be stubbed or implemented to provide basic navigation or language selection functionality. The actual implementation of these functions is outside the scope of this document.
*   **Forms:** While the form itself contains hidden fields, the form submission action `/Renew/AddressChangeServlet` and method `POST` should be preserved.

**4. Exclusions**

*   **CSS Styling:** All CSS styling (e.g., colors, fonts, layout) is excluded.
*   **Images:** While image references are noted (e.g., header images, button images), the actual image files themselves are not provided and should be represented with placeholders.
*   **Search, Navigation, and Standard Footer:** These common elements, while likely present on the live site, are excluded from this document to focus on the specific content of the address change page.
