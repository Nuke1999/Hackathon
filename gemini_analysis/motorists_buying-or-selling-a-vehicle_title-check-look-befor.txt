    2.  Have your credit card available.

**4.2. NMVTIS Explanation**

*   **Text:**
    The VIN is run through the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System (NMVTIS), a national consumer protection database that provides title information from states across the country. Whether you are buying from a local dealer, individual or eyeing a vehicle from an online auction website, it will help you to know what you are buying before you pay any money or sign any paperwork for the vehicle.

    A report from the NMVTIS database gives you the vehicle’s title history, which includes whether the vehicle was ever in the possession of a junk or salvage yard or declared a “total loss” by an insurance company.

        How to Buy a Used Vehicle

        When you buy a used vehicle in Texas, the state does not provide any warranty or consumer protection on the reliability of that vehicle. It is up to you to make sure you are doing everything you can protect yourself – whether you are buying from a dealer or individual.

        For passenger cars and pickup trucks, dealers are required by law to post a “Buyers Guide” on the vehicle, which will tell you whether it is being sold “as is” or with a warranty.

        *   **Title Check.** Before you buy, take down the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and go to [Link to /motorists/buying-or-selling-a-vehicle/title-check-look-before-you-buy with the text "Title Check"] on the TxDMV website to use the national motor vehicle database to make sure the vehicle has a clean title.
        *   **Mechanic Inspection.** Have a trusted mechanic look over the vehicle before you sign any paperwork or pay any money, including a down payment.
        *   **Service Report.** Use a vehicle history company to get accident repair and maintenance records.
        *   **Sales Contract.** Be sure to read all of the documents, including sales agreements or buyer’s orders before you sign them.
        *   **Vehicle Title.** Never, ever walk away from a private sale without the title. Have the seller print and sign their name, provide the sales date, and enter the odometer reading on the back of the title.
        *   [Link to /sites/default/files/form_files/130-U.pdf with the text "Application for Texas Title and/or Registration (Form 130-U)"]. Make sure the seller prints and signs their name, and enters the sales price on this form. You must have this form when you apply for title.
        *   [Link to <https://permit.txdmv.gov/Permit/VTPermit> with the text "Vehicle Transit Permit"]. The seller should keep the vehicle plates. Downloading the Vehicle Transit Permit from the TxDMV website gives you 5 days to legally drive the vehicle so you can go to your county tax office to apply for title and registration.
        *   **County Tax Office.** You must apply for a new title within 30 days of purchasing the vehicle or you will be charged financial penalties.

    Besides the title history, the TxDMV recommends you also consider purchasing a complete vehicle history service report from one of many private companies that offer this service. These reports generally includes maintenance and repair records. We also recommend that you have the vehicle inspected by a reputable mechanic before making your purchase.

    If you have purchased a vehicle from a Texas dealer and you discover an issue with the vehicle’s title history you may want to file a [Link to /complaints with the text "Consumer Complaint with TxDMV's Enforcement Division."].
    
    NMVTIS Background

    On October 25, 1992, President George H.W. Bush signed the Anti Car Theft Act, which he called “absolutely critical if we are to strike back against auto thieves...”

    The act calls for the creation and use of the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System to stop title fraud; vehicle export inspections to look for stolen vehicles; stiffer penalties for car thieves and chop shop operators; and makes carjacking a federal crime.

    “These criminals, who show no respect for the lives or property of law-abiding Americans, must be punished in the strongest possible manner,” President Bush said.

    The U.S. Department of Justice, effective 1996, handles the motor vehicle database system. The TxDMV partnered with the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators to administer NMVTIS. NMVTIS works to limit the consumer and title fraud of vehicles nationwide.

    Texas aggressively combats title fraud and auto theft. The TxDMV investigates title fraud and consumer complaints with the assistance of law enforcement. The agency houses the Motor Vehicle Crime Prevention Authority, providing law enforcement agencies and consumers with auto theft and burglary grants and detection training.
