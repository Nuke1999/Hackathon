This document details the content requirements for recreating the "Motorists" page on the TxDMV.gov website.  It focuses on the core content areas, excluding site-wide elements like navigation, search, and language selection.

**2. Goal**

To provide a clear specification of the text, links, and structure required to implement the main content of the Motorists page.

    *   **How do I make a surety bond claim?**
        Many independent dealers are required to have a surety bond, and these dealers must post a bond notice at their business location near their dealer license. This notice includes contact information for the dealer’s bond company so customers have the information necessary to file a claim.

        The surety bond requirement applies to all GDN license types except for Trailer/Semitrailer and Non-Motorized Travel Trailer. The bond requirement does not apply to Franchised dealers issued a GDN license associated to a Franchised dealer license.
        If bond information is not posted in the dealer’s office, motorists can submit a Public Information Act (PIA) request to get the name of the dealer’s bond company.
