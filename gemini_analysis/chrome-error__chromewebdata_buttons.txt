## Product Requirements Document: Error Page Recreation

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the content requirements for recreating a specific error page, mirroring the one displayed when `www.txdmv.gov` is unreachable. The implementor is an AI and will have limited context. This document focuses solely on the text-based content of the error page. Design and layout elements are not included.

**2. Goal**

To accurately represent the error message and suggestions presented to the user when the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles website is unavailable.

**3. Scope**

This document covers all text displayed within the main content area of the error page. It excludes elements like navigation, search bars, footers, language selectors, and repetitive details such as browser-specific formatting.
