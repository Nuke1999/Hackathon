The International Registration Plan (IRP) and the International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) each allow the use of electronic devices to document vehicle distance by jurisdiction provided that the required supporting data is maintained for audit purposes. The purchase of an ELD does not necessarily mean it will be compliant for IFTA and IRP purposes or vice versa. Beware of vendors stating that their systems are IFTA or IRP certified. There is no such certification. See the Electronic Logging Device page on the International Registration Plan, Inc.’s web site to access a chart showing some of the key differences and similarities between an ELD and a compliant IFTA/IRP electronic records device: <a href="https://www.irponline.org/page/ELD">https://www.irponline.org/page/ELD</a>"

As a result, every motor carrier registered with the TxIRP will be subject to a compliance examination of their operational records."
