## Product Requirements Document: Trailers Page

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the content requirements for recreating the "Trailers" page on the TxDMV.gov website. This page provides information about trailer registration and titling in Texas.

**2. Goals**

*   Provide clear and accurate information about trailer registration and titling requirements in Texas.
*   Differentiate requirements based on trailer type (manufactured, homemade/assembled, farm) and weight.
*   Guide users to the appropriate forms and resources.
*   Offer resources for locating local tax offices and DMVs.

**3. Content Requirements**

**3.1 Main Content Area**

**3.1.1 Introduction Text:**

"Registration is required for all non-farm trailers operating on public highways. Registration and titling requirements vary according to trailer type and weight. Most utility trailers fall into two categories:

1.  Manufactured (built by a trailer manufacturer)
2.  Homemade (built by an individual in their garage or shop)

In addition, trailers are categorized by:

*   Gross weights (the trailer weight plus the weight it can carry) under
*   Over 4,000 lbs."

**3.1.2 Section: Determine the Type of Trailer You Have**

"Start by looking on the trailer tongue. This is where you are most likely to find the manufacturerâ€™s name, which confirms you have a manufactured trailer. If you do not know whether the trailer is manufactured or homemade, it must be inspected by an auto theft law enforcement officer. To find the nearest inspection location with an auto theft law enforcement officer, contact your local county tax assessor-collector office or TxDMV Regional Service Center."

**3.1.3 Tabbed Content:**

The following information should be presented within a tabbed interface with the following tabs:

*   **Manufactured Trailers**
    *   "If your manufactured trailer's gross weight exceeds 4,000 lbs., it must be titled. Submit the following documents to your county tax assessor-collector office:"
        *   "A completed [Application for Texas Title and or Registration (Form 130-U)](/sites/default/files/form_files/130-U.pdf)"
        *   "Applicable fees"
        *   "Evidence of ownership, as defined in the table below"

        " \* The Manufacturer's Certificate of Origin (MCO) is the document that allows you to register and/or title a new trailer. This is your trailer's "birth certificate," showing its unique identification information. A trailer manufacturer is required to provide a MCO to dealers or purchasers for every vehicle it manufactures."

        **Note:** "A manufactured trailer with missing paperwork cannot be registered as a homemade trailer."

*   **Assembled Trailers**
    *   "Newly assembled trailers (including farm trailers) must be titled regardless of weight. For additional information on required documents and the titling process, please visit [Assembled Vehicles](/motorists/assembled-vehicles). Assembled trailers with a non-titled record in Texas or registration receipt from another state may continue to be non-titled. If you currently have a non-titled record, and you opt to apply for title for your assembled trailer then the documents below are required."
